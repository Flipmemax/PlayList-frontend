# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **PlayList**!

## About

PlayList is still in **development** and new features will be added. This app will allow users to create PlayLists with music from different providers (Spotify, SoundCloud, Apple music, YouTube music, Deezer etc). The music in their PlayList can then be listened to within the app itself, this way users won't have to switch between music apps anymore and they'll have their favorite music in one place.

## Page overview

Homepage - This is basically where all the magic happens. You can see your PlayLists, create PlayLists and search for music. Connect to music providers and logout.
Login - Users can only get to the homepage when they are logged in.
Signup - This is where you create a profile.
